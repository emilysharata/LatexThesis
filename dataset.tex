\section{Data set exploration}

The job offers corpus contains 8565 job offers written in French, English, German, and Italian and contains positions from a wide range of Swiss cantons. Below is a description of each variable in the job offers data set:

\textbf{JOB ID}: A unique numerical identifier assigned to each job offer in the corpus.

\textbf{ISCO}: An identifier that relates the job posting to the Swiss Standard 	
Classification of Occupations (CH-ISCO-19). This fact sheet is published by the Federal
Statistical Office and is used for several federal labour market surveys. 

\textbf{SKILLS}: A list of text keywords describing the skills, sectors, or industries related to each job offer.

\textbf{CANTON}:The canton the job offer was originally advertised in. 

\textbf{WORK EXPERIENCE}: A list of keywords describing job titles related to each job offer.

\textbf{EDUCATIONAL LEVEL}: The educational experience desired by each job offer.

\textbf{DATE}: The date the job offer was published. 

\textbf{COMPANY}: The name of the company advertising the job offer. 

\textbf{JOB TITLE}: The official job title of the job offer. 

\textbf{JOBS}: A list of keywords related to the official job title.

\textbf{CONTENT}: The raw text of the job offer, written in French, English, German, Italian, or some combination. 

Data sets of environmentally-related skills and activities were also compiled by the GE-EN-VIE researchers in order to create reference documents to match the contents of the job offers to. Below of is a description of the activities data set:

\textbf{ACTIVITY ID}: A unique numerical ID assigned to each environmentally related activity.

\textbf{O*Net - All the jobs}: A short list of broad keywords that describe the category of skills the detailed activities fall under. 

\textbf{O*Net - Green jobs}: A unique numerical ID assigned to each activity description.

\textbf{O*Net - Details of the activities for green jobs }: A sentence describing each occupational activity in detail, as listed in the O*Net database. 

\textbf{Terms (verbs) found in the 120 "environment" job offers}: A list of individual verbs related to the sentences of detailed activities.

\textbf{Terms (adjectives) found in the 120 "environment" job offers}: A list of individual adjectives related to the sentences of detailed activities. 

The description of the data set of the environmentally-related skills is as follows: 

\textbf{SKILL ID}: A unique numerical ID assigned to each environmentally related skill.

\textbf{SKILL}:  A sentence describing each occupational skill in detail, as listed in the O*Net database. 

To assist with the automatic classification of environmentally related and non-environmentally related jobs, a total of 536 jobs were manually labeled as such by Marie-Jos√© Genolet Viaccoz. In addition, a total of 1000 jobs from the job offers corpus were analyzed in an exploratory analysis to gain a better understanding of the data set. 

The distribution of jobs by location, shown per canton in Switzerland, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cantons}. The majority of the jobs postings are for positions in Bern and Vaud, followed by Geneva. Of all the cantons, Geneva has the highest ratio of environmental jobs to non-environmental jobs.

Most of the jobs in the data set were sourced from small or midsize companies. The proportion of environmentally related jobs to non-environmentally related jobs is relatively consistent across company size, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:companysize}.

With regards to the number of sentences in each job description, a greater number of non-environmentally related jobs had descriptions with fewer sentences, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:sentencelength}. Many of these job descriptions do not contain enough information about the job or company to be classified as environmentally related.


\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}


The distribution of the number of sentences in the entire data set is similar to that of the subset of 536 labeled job offers, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:sentencelengthall}. The vast majority of the job offers contain fewer than 20 sentences.

\end{figure}


A large number of job descriptions in the data set have fewer than 200 characters as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:charlength}. Likewise, as with the number of sentences, job descriptions with small amounts of text are more frequently classified as as non-environmentally related.
