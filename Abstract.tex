\chapter*{Abstract}

This work investigates techniques for classifying 
job offers advertised in Switzerland according to whether or not they involve environmentally and non-environmentally related tasks. A method for extracting the advertised skills and activities of the job offers is also explored. This research builds upon work performed by the GE-EN-VIE network in semantic textual analysis.  A corpus of over 8000 job offers, provided by recruitment agency X28, are considered in the analysis. A binary classification model based on deep neural networks is built to categorize the job offers. Google's Universal Sentence Encoder is utilized to perform semantic textual similarity measures between the content of the job offers and a pre-compiled database of common environmentally related occupational skills and activities. Qualitative results of the categorization and textual similarity methods are discussed.
